# Visitor can mark their chosen empty box on the board with a number between 1-9, and then press Enter to confirm their choice.
# Each box can be chosen only once during each game.
# Goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to get 3 of the same symbols in a straight line: vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

# Create an option for the player to enter their name up to 10 characters or just initials? ("Please press 'Enter' after typing your name or initials")
# Create Error messages if not letters, if using symbols, if longer than 10 characters. Can you have an alert if they haven't pressed Enter after certain amount
# of time?
